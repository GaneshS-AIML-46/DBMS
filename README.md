# RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

 This project presents the design and implementation of a College Resource Management
 System (CRMS), a comprehensive solution aimed at efficiently managing and allocating
 resources within educational institutions. The system enables college staff to request
 resources such as classrooms, laboratory equipment, and other facilities for academic and
 administrative purposes. CRMS automates the entire process, from resource request
 submission to approval and allocation, ensuring optimal utilization and availability of
 resources. The system comprises several modules, including Staff Management,
 Resource Inventory, Request Handling, and Resource Allocation. Staff members can log
 in to submit requests, view the status of their requests, and receive notifications for
 approved or denied requests. Administrators can monitor resource availability, approve or
 reject requests, and manage allocation conflicts. The system also tracks the lifecycle of
 resource allocation, including return and maintenance scheduling, ensuring resources are
 maintained and available for future use.
